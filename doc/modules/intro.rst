======================
Intro to spin
======================

This application has been developed as application for my bachelor's degree in computer engineering.

It doesn't aim to be "The new Social Network", but to offer a learning tool, developed for educational scopes.

Who thinks to modify this app should; that's the scope of this release and of all the work. I'm putting this project on github,
hoping someone wants to take part.

The name is spin, which represents the development cycle, hoping it could improve this app.
Finally, thanks to Ribbit developers. They gave us the idea to start this work, thanks them all.
Our first idea was to extend Ribbit, but it doesn't seem correct regards their work.
That's all. Hope this code is not so much bad and I'm sorry if at this moment doc is so poor.
